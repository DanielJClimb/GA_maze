# GA_maze
Aim of this project is to find exit from the maze in 30 moves. To solve this problem, I used Genetic Algorithm with help of python package Pygad. At the beginnig, I declare list with location of walls. Next, I create two variables containg location of start and exit. After that, I set all necessary hiperparameters for genetic algorithm. Rest is done by Pygad.

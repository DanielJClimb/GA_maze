# Genetic algorithms
This repository contains three folders: maze, metal_alloys and n_queens_completion_problem.
Maze conatins scirpt , which uses python package Pygad to find exit from maze. Scipt is given locations of wall, start and exit.
Metal_alloys contains scirpt, which is used to find proportions of six metals to create alloys with highest endurance. N_queens_completion_problem contains jupyter notebook with measuring accuracy and efficiency of solving n-queens completion problem using
two versions of genetic algorithms.
